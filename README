These are images for the ODROID XU3/XU4, built as close as possible 
to unmodified Debian. They will only be updated every now and then,
so if you want something current, run the script to build them yourself.
The image is signed with my GnuPG key; you can find the key in the
Debian keyring.

The prebuilt images are made for 1GB cards, so they should fit onto
pretty much any modern SD card.
