This is a fork of https://git.sesse.net/?p=debian-xu4.

These are images for the ODROID XU3/XU4, built as close as possible 
to unmodified Debian. They will only be updated every now and then,
so if you want something current, run the script to build them yourself.
The image is signed with my GnuPG key; you can find the key in the
Debian keyring.

The prebuilt images are made for 1GB cards, so they should fit onto
pretty much any modern SD or MMC card. Root images built for SD cards
will fit work on MMC devices but not the other way round (the prebuilt
root images are for SD).

If you want to update the boot partition of an eMMC device (where
U-Boot lives), you will need to unlock it before Linux lets you
write to it, e.g.:

  echo 0 > /sys/block/mmcblk0boot0/force_ro

SD cards do not have hardware partitions (U-Boot is stored on the same
block device as everything else), so all you need to do is to decompress
the image and dd it to the card.
