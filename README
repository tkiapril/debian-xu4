This is a fork of https://git.sesse.net/?p=debian-xu4.

Tips: If you use both SD Card and eMMC for OS, initially you will boot to the opposite media you selected with the switch.
This is due to a strange default in boot_targets env ( https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=827580 ).
In order to work this out, you need a serial console; on boot, repeatadly and rapidly press any key to abort u-boot boot. Then, modify boot_targets to have mmc0 on first (e.g. env set boot_targets mmc0 mmc1 pxe dhcp) then save (env save).
Unfortunately, this solution only works if you select SD Card as boot device; saveenv does not work on eMMC boot ( https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=827581 ).
In my case where I use eMMC as main and SD Card as backup, I use SD Card as boot media with default env and change env only on occations when I have to boot to SD Card.
